    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Hello world!</h2>

    <p>
      Hi, Iâ€™m Jake Coffman and I am a Software Developer in St. Louis Missouri.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a Bachelors in Computer Science and have worked professionally in C++, Python, JavaScript,
      Java, Groovy, Ruby, Go, and C#.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I started out working on low level security libraries and various security related GUIs at Cerner.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then I moved on to doing low level network programming on a 3-D distributed simulation of fighter jets
      at Boeing. I started to pick up web development while I was there, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      I then moved to a startup called Appistry where I helped create an ETL system that took HL7 data and
      transformed it into SQL, and created a search interface. I also did various other "Big Data" web interfaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now I am at World Wide Technology where I specialize in RESTful API design and
      UI development with VueJS.
    </p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I like game development and have been working on games in my free time. Game development is
      refreshing and completely unlike web development which I have been doing for my day job. Working in 2D and 3D with physics engines is a fun challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also like web development as a way to expose what I do to potentially billions of people.
